# TRY100

Use of a `try` ... `except` block where the except block does not contain anything other than comments and a `pass` statement is considered bad security practice.

Whilst an attacker may be trying to exploit exceptions in your code, you should, at the very least, log these exceptions.

## Example 

```python
try:
    do_things
except ThisBadException:
    # do nothing!
    pass
```

## Fixes

* Fix the reason why the exception occurs
* Consider using a `raise from` statement
* Add logging to the except block
